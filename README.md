I.	Name of Concept

New Leaf

II.	General description

New Leaf is a web application capable of delivering remote health monitoring for management of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. New Leaf was built using Internet of Things technology and will soon support tracking blood pressure and heart rate for chronic disease prevention. Features include goal setting, personalized feedback, and a focus on alleviating data entry burden. Additionally, it provides physicians with data analytics on patients’ habits between visits.

III.	Why is it needed?

28% of Wisconsin adults are prediabetic and 30% have hypertension putting them at risk for cardiovascular disease. 1 in 8 healthcare dollars are spent to ineffectively combat these diseases, which are preventable with diet and exercise. Despite proven efficacy of in-person prevention programs, lack of physician referrals and socioeconomic barriers contribute to low participation. Self-monitoring of habits using smart technology predicts long-term success by sustaining lifestyle changes. However, data-entry burden and inaccurate data contribute to low engagement. We are developing accurate and automated self-monitoring tools for chronic disease prevention, focused on alleviating these pain points.
 

IV. What are the risks associated with your concept? 
Data security and data loss is our biggest risk, which we will prevent using industry standard security practices. This will include user authentication, defining user roles and privileges, and encrypting health data. We will never share or sell user information.
