// This file contains all of the css that is needed for all of the pages and components of the web app. To make any 
// changes all you need to do is open the associated "_partial.scss." file which will be referenced in the comments above
// each of the imported partial files. The Sass css output file that is generated from this one is formatted so that 
// it watches all of the patial components for changes. 

// to see the changes in each of the individual patrials.scss files 
// you need to run "sass web-app-styling.scss web-app-styling.css" in terminal
// to have it compile all of the css and update the main css file (web-app-styling.css) 
// because this is the only file that is referenced in the .js files
